# Rustlings
#### What is rustlings?
[Rustings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) is a set of exercises for learning rust. It is a popular tool for rust beginners.<br>

#### My Experience with Rustlings.
I have used rustlings a wee bit during my rust journey, but so far my learning has focused on small-scope rust projects in familiar settings (data & python), such as with: [harley](github.com/TomBurdge/harley), [faux_lars](github.com/TomBurdge/faux_lars), and [polari](github.com/TomBurdge/polari). I have also focused on Luca Palmieri's excellent workshops (under workshops sub-heading [here](https://www.lpalmieri.com/talks/)).<br>

For me, rustlings feel a little more like exercises than pedgagogic devices for new material; something to use for confidence and revision when you have already covered the topics.<br>

Therefore, this is the result of some hours (mostly during train journeys), revising rust concepts and working through the exercises.
